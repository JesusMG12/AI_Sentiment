# Sentiment_Analysis_of_AI_Perception

This study examines public sentiment towards artificial intelligence (AI) by analyzing three decades of New York Times articles. Employing sentiment analysis, the research captures evolving perceptions, from optimism surrounding technological advancements to concerns over ethical implications. Initial data cleaning ensures a robust dataset, removing duplicates and standardizing dates. Sentiment scores are categorized from "Very Negative" to "Very Positive," and the dataset is balanced to mitigate bias. Exploratory data analysis reveals sentiment distribution, trends over time, and prevalent themes using visualizations such as word clouds. For in-depth analysis, combining TF-IDF and K-means clustering allow the identification of sentiment patterns, and transformer-based models like BERT and VADER classify the sentiment of texts. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring comprehensive sentiment classification. The studyâ€™s findings aim to inform AI researchers by providing insights into public opinion, with the potential to guide responsible AI development and policy-making.
